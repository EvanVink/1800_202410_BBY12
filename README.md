# Vancouver Crime Watch


## 1. Project Description
Our app is a crime safety app. The main feature is that the user can see their location on a map interface and they can see crime hotspots around them. The user can also have a list of friends that they can add, and they can choose to view their location and also see if that user is in an SOS. The user can also view a map page that has live news coverage, being able to filter by location. The user story we aimed to target the most is someone that is nervous about walking alone in Vancouver. The app will help them feel safe knowing where crimes tend to happen around them. We also want to target families because our social page allows families to see each other and keep tabs on each other's status.
